    <h2>I Like To Create</h2>
    <p>
      Expressing myself in creative ways has always been my main form of
      communication for many years. I would make music that would convey how I
      feel about my relationship to things and people around me. Hell, I would
      write massive conceptual stories that parallel my life. Then I would go
      and write and record soundtracks to them! I still do that. Photography
      though came into my life in a different way. My mother’s husband had this
      old Yashica point and shoot camera when I was a teenager. I remember not
      really understanding how it worked because I didn’t really know where to
      get film from. I was in England at this time, but I remember being so
      fascinated by it. I thought it was so cool.

      Fast forward years and I’m an adult now. The first camera I ever bought
      was a Nikon 3400. I had planned to do some sort of content creation and
      wanted to take my music project ( MAC vs PC eventually renamed to be
      WEATHER & AGE ) more seriously. I planned to do video and pictures
      documenting my journey writing and recording the process, but that ended
      up being too challenging. I just remember being more interested in
      pointing my camera at other things. This is all before any sort of formal
      training into photography.

      It wasn’t until I took a photography 101 class later on in life. My
      teacher, Professor Ting, ignited a passion for capturing images that was
      just incredible. I hated it at first because I wanted to be good right
      away. The process was very therapeutic for me. Being in the darkroom, with
      the lights off but the hue of amber, was just right for me.
    </p>

      After that class, I just took off with film photography and never looked
      back. I started out doing as many portrait photo sessions as I could. I
      was at as many car events that I could be at. Photowalks..I was walkin and
      shootin. After about two years of doing that, I realized, and then
      decided, that was not what I wanted to capture anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I love to capture are very special moments. Things that make me feel
      a type of way after experiencing that moment. Alot of the time I won’t
      know THAT’S THAT MOMENT until after my film is developed, but my eyes,
      mind, and heart are focused on how everything is moving in relationship to
      me. The idea of all this is always evolving, but I guess that’s what is so
      great about art and creative expression. Things change and that can create
      duality. As much as I enjoy the special moments, I have learned to
      appreciate the more dark moments, and look for those moments to capture as
      well.
